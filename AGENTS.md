# AGENTS.md

Dash is a modern dashboard / analytics platform.

## Agentic conventions
- Issue tracker: GitHub Issues
- Labels: bug, enhancement, documentation, accessibility, security
- ADR directory: docs/adr/
- CHANGELOG: CHANGELOG.md
- Default branch: main
- Package manager: pnpm

## Safe Chain

Package installs in this environment go through Aikido Safe Chain shims. Never bypass them:

- Keep `~/.safe-chain/shims` first on `PATH`.
- Do not call unshimmed `npm`, `pnpm`, `npx`, or `pnpx`.
- Do not install packages with `curl | sh` or by pointing at a package manager outside the shim directory.

## Pull requests

Opening a pull request is not the end of the task. Wait about 20 minutes for automated and human code
reviews to land, then follow up on every comment that carries a finding, question, or change request
before starting anything else:

- Judge each comment against the code, not against the reviewer: is the finding actually true here?
- Valid: make the fix, run the same checks CI runs, push, and reply inline on that thread with what
  changed and the commit SHA.
- Not valid: reply inline on that thread with the concrete reason it does not apply (cite the file and
  line), and leave the thread open for the reviewer to close.
- Never leave such a comment unanswered, and never resolve a thread you disagree with. The only
  comments to skip are ones that need no answer — your own replies echoed back, plain approvals,
  pleasantries, and status-only bot notices — because answering those just restarts the loop.
- After each push, wait again and repeat until CI is green and every actionable thread has a reply.
